I'm quite excited that Bluetooth Low Energy (nRF51822) is comming to mbed. So I'm exploring what we can do with BLE (nRF51822). Preparing tools to get started with new things is always the beginning.

Here we use [CMSIS-DAP](https://github.com/mbedmicro/CMSIS-DAP) and [pyOCD](https://github.com/mbedmicro/pyOCD). [CMSIS-DAP](https://github.com/mbedmicro/CMSIS-DAP) is the software running on mbed interface to provide drag-n-drop, USB2UART communication and SWD debug. pyOCD is an Open Source python library or programming and debugging ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers using CMSIS-DAP.

First, use [Arch](http://mbed.org/platforms/Seeeduino-Arch/) as an mbed interface to run [CMSIS-DAP](https://github.com/mbedmicro/CMSIS-DAP). 

1. Download [mbed interface firmware for Arch](https://github.com/xiongyihui/CMSIS-DAP/raw/lpc11u24/interface/mdk/lpc11u24/lpc11u24_nrf51822_if_mbed.bin).
2. Connect Arch with PC, long press Arch's button and replace firmware.bin with the new firmware in "CRP DISABLD" drive on windows. use `dd if=lpc11u24_nrf51822_if_mbed.bin of={path-to}/firmware.bin conv=notrunc` on [Linux/Mac](http://mbed.org/users/seeed/notebook/programming-seeeduino-arch/)
3. Quick press the button. "MBED" drive will pop up.
4. Install the [mbed interface driver](http://mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration) for windows to enable USB2UART function

Second, setup pyOCD for nRF51822. We need pyOCD, pyUSB(Linux) or pyWinUSB(Windows) and [flash_nrf51822.py](https://github.com/xiongyihui/pyOCD/raw/master/util/flash_nrf51822.py)

On Ubuntu

~~~ shell
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
sudo easy_install pyusb
sudo easy_install pyocd
sudo easy_install intelhex
wget https://github.com/xiongyihui/pyOCD/raw/master/util/flash_nrf51822.py
~~~

On windows, install pyWinUSB instread of pyUSB.


Third, flash a hex file generated by mbed online compiler or an application binary file to nRF51822.

The hex file includes threee parts --- Code Region 0 (CR0), Code Region 1 (CR1) and User Information Configuration Registers (UICR). To flash the hex file, run

~~~
sudo python flash_nrf51822.py -i {ble.hex}
~~~

To flash an application binary with an offset 0x14000

~~~
sudo python flash_nrf51822.py -b {app.bin}
~~~
